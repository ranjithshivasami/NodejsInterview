## Node js Interview

---

### 1. **Basic Concepts**

1. **What is Node.js, and how does it differ from JavaScript in the browser?**  
   - Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine from Google Chrome.  
   - **Difference**:  
     - Node.js provides APIs like `fs`, `http`, and `path` for server-side operations, which browsers don’t.  
     - Browsers focus on DOM manipulation and client-side tasks.

---

2. **Explain the key features of Node.js.**  
   - **Event-driven architecture**: Handles many connections concurrently.  
   - **Non-blocking I/O**: Ensures scalability for handling requests.  
   - **Single-threaded**: Uses a single thread for event handling via the event loop.  
   - **Cross-platform**: Runs on major operating systems.  
   - **Rich ecosystem**: Powered by NPM for package management.
---
3. **What is the V8 engine, and how does it relate to Node.js?**  
   - V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google.  
   - It compiles JavaScript into machine code, enabling high performance in both browsers and Node.js.
---
4. **What is the difference between Node.js and other server-side frameworks like Django or Spring?**  
   - Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, suited for I/O-heavy tasks.  
   - Django (Python) and Spring (Java) are multi-threaded and better suited for CPU-intensive tasks.  
   - Node.js is lightweight but less opinionated than Django or Spring.
---
5. **How does the event loop work in Node.js?**  
   - The event loop processes tasks in phases (timers, I/O callbacks, idle/prepare, etc.).  
   - Non-blocking operations are delegated to the system and added back to the loop upon completion.

### 2. **Asynchronous Programming**

6. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Node.js?**  
   - **Synchronous**: Blocks code execution until the task is completed.  
   - **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking; code execution continues without waiting for the task.

---
7. **What are callbacks, and how are they used in Node.js?**  
   - Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions to execute after the completion of a task.  
   ```javascript
   fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => { 
     if (err) throw err;
     console.log(data.toString());
   });

   ```

8. **Explain the purpose of `async` and `await` in Node.js.**  
   - Simplifies asynchronous code with promises, making it more readable.  
```javascript
   async function fetchData() {
     const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com');
     console.log(data);
   }

  ```

---

9. **How does Node.js handle concurrency?**  
   - Through the event loop and non-blocking I/O, Node.js can handle multiple requests simultaneously without creating new threads.

---
10. **What are promises, and how do they differ from callbacks?**  
    - Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an async operation.  
    - Promises reduce "callback hell" by chaining `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.

---

### 3. **Modules and NPM**

11. **What are Node.js modules, and how are they used?**  
    - Modules are reusable pieces of code (e.g., core modules like `fs`, `http`).  
    - Use `require` to import modules.
 ---
12. **Explain the difference between `require` and `import` in Node.js.**  
    - `require`: CommonJS syntax, used in older Node.js versions.  
    - `import`: ES6 syntax, used in modern JavaScript.

13. **How do you create a custom module in Node.js?**  
    ```javascript
    // customModule.js
    module.exports = () => "Hello from custom module!";
    // main.js
    const customModule = require('./customModule');
    console.log(customModule());
    ```

14. **What is NPM, and how does it work with Node.js?**  
    - NPM is a package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to share and reuse code.  
    - Install a package: `npm install package-name`.

15. **Explain the purpose of `package.json` in a Node.js project.**  
    - Describes the project’s dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

---

### 4. **Event Emitters**

16. **What is an EventEmitter in Node.js, and how does it work?**  
    - A class from the `events` module used to handle events.  
    - Example:  
    ```javascript
    const EventEmitter = require('events');
    const emitter = new EventEmitter();
    emitter.on('event', () => console.log('Event triggered!'));
    emitter.emit('event');
    ```

17. **How do you listen for and emit events using the `EventEmitter` class?**  
    - Use `on` for listening and `emit` to trigger events.

18. **What are some common use cases for event-driven programming in Node.js?**  
    - Handling I/O, user interactions, and real-time applications (e.g., chat apps).

---

### 5. **Streams and Buffers**

19. **What are streams in Node.js? List the types of streams.**  
    - Streams handle reading/writing of data in chunks. Types:  
      - Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform.

20. **How do you handle stream errors in Node.js?**  
    - Use the `error` event listener:  
    ```javascript
    stream.on('error', (err) => console.error(err));
    ```

21. **What is the purpose of a buffer in Node.js?**  
    - Buffers represent fixed-size binary data used in streams.

22. **Explain how to read and write data using streams in Node.js.**  
    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');
    const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
    const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');
    readStream.pipe(writeStream);
    ```
