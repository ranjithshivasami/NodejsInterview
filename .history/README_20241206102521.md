## Node js Interview

---

### 1. **Basic Concepts**

1. **What is Node.js, and how does it differ from JavaScript in the browser?**  
   - Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine from Google Chrome.  
   - **Difference**:  
     - Node.js provides APIs like `fs`, `http`, and `path` for server-side operations, which browsers don’t.  
     - Browsers focus on DOM manipulation and client-side tasks.

---

2. **Explain the key features of Node.js.**  
   - **Event-driven architecture**: Handles many connections concurrently.  
   - **Non-blocking I/O**: Ensures scalability for handling requests.  
   - **Single-threaded**: Uses a single thread for event handling via the event loop.  
   - **Cross-platform**: Runs on major operating systems.  
   - **Rich ecosystem**: Powered by NPM for package management.
---
3. **What is the V8 engine, and how does it relate to Node.js?**  
   - V8 is an open-source JavaScript engine developed by Google.  
   - It compiles JavaScript into machine code, enabling high performance in both browsers and Node.js.
---
4. **What is the difference between Node.js and other server-side frameworks like Django or Spring?**  
   - Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, suited for I/O-heavy tasks.  
   - Django (Python) and Spring (Java) are multi-threaded and better suited for CPU-intensive tasks.  
   - Node.js is lightweight but less opinionated than Django or Spring.
---
5. **How does the event loop work in Node.js?**  
   - The event loop processes tasks in phases (timers, I/O callbacks, idle/prepare, etc.).  
   - Non-blocking operations are delegated to the system and added back to the loop upon completion.  

---

### 2. **Asynchronous Programming**

6. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous programming in Node.js?**  
   - **Synchronous**: Blocks code execution until the task is completed.  
   - **Asynchronous**: Non-blocking; code execution continues without waiting for the task.

---
7. **What are callbacks, and how are they used in Node.js?**  
   - Callbacks are functions passed as arguments to other functions to execute after the completion of a task.  
   ```javascript
   fs.readFile('file.txt', (err, data) => { 
     if (err) throw err;
     console.log(data.toString());
   });

   ```
---


8. **Explain the purpose of `async` and `await` in Node.js.**  
   - Simplifies asynchronous code with promises, making it more readable.  
```javascript
   async function fetchData() {
     const data = await fetch('https://api.example.com');
     console.log(data);
   }

  ```

---

9. **How does Node.js handle concurrency?**  
   - Through the event loop and non-blocking I/O, Node.js can handle multiple requests simultaneously without creating new threads.

---
10. **What are promises, and how do they differ from callbacks?**  
    - Promises represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an async operation.  
    - Promises reduce "callback hell" by chaining `.then()` and `.catch()` methods.

---

### 3. **Modules and NPM**

11. **What are Node.js modules, and how are they used?**  
    - Modules are reusable pieces of code (e.g., core modules like `fs`, `http`).  
    - Use `require` to import modules.
 ---
12. **Explain the difference between `require` and `import` in Node.js.**  
    - `require`: CommonJS syntax, used in older Node.js versions.  
    - `import`: ES6 syntax, used in modern JavaScript.

---

13. **How do you create a custom module in Node.js?**  
```javascript
// customModule.js
module.exports = () => "Hello from custom module!";
// main.js
const customModule = require('./customModule');
console.log(customModule());
```
---

14. **What is NPM, and how does it work with Node.js?**  
    - NPM is a package manager for Node.js, allowing developers to share and reuse code.  
    - Install a package: `npm install package-name`.

---

15. **Explain the purpose of `package.json` in a Node.js project.**  
    - Describes the project’s dependencies, scripts, and metadata.

---

### 4. **Event Emitters**

16. **What is an EventEmitter in Node.js, and how does it work?**  
    - A class from the `events` module used to handle events.  
    - Example:  
```javascript
const EventEmitter = require('events');
const emitter = new EventEmitter();
emitter.on('event', () => console.log('Event triggered!'));
emitter.emit('event');
```
---

17. **How do you listen for and emit events using the `EventEmitter` class?**  
    - Use `on` for listening and `emit` to trigger events.

---

18. **What are some common use cases for event-driven programming in Node.js?**  
    - Handling I/O, user interactions, and real-time applications (e.g., chat apps).

---

### 5. **Streams and Buffers**

19. **What are streams in Node.js? List the types of streams.**  
    - Streams handle reading/writing of data in chunks. Types:  
      - Readable, Writable, Duplex, Transform.

---

20. **How do you handle stream errors in Node.js?**  
    - Use the `error` event listener:  
  ```javascript
  stream.on('error', (err) => console.error(err));
  ```
---

21. **What is the purpose of a buffer in Node.js?**  
    - Buffers represent fixed-size binary data used in streams.

---

22. **Explain how to read and write data using streams in Node.js.**  
```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const readStream = fs.createReadStream('input.txt');
const writeStream = fs.createWriteStream('output.txt');
readStream.pipe(writeStream);
```

### 6. **File System**

23. **How do you read and write files in Node.js?**  
    - Use the `fs` module.  
    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');
    // Read
    fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(data);
    });
    // Write
    fs.writeFile('file.txt', 'Hello, Node.js!', (err) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log('File written successfully');
    });
    ```

24. **What is the difference between `fs.readFile` and `fs.readFileSync`?**  
    - `fs.readFile`: Asynchronous, non-blocking.  
    - `fs.readFileSync`: Synchronous, blocking.  
    - Prefer asynchronous for scalability.

25. **How do you watch for file changes in Node.js?**  
    - Use `fs.watch` or `fs.watchFile`.  
    ```javascript
    fs.watch('file.txt', (eventType, filename) => {
      console.log(`File ${filename} changed: ${eventType}`);
    });
    ```

26. **How do you handle errors in the File System module?**  
    - Always check for errors in callbacks or use `try-catch` for synchronous methods.  
    ```javascript
    fs.readFile('nonexistent.txt', (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.error('Error reading file:', err);
      }
    });
    ```

    ```javascript
    const http = require('http');
    http.get('http://example.com', (res) => {
      res.on('data', (chunk) => console.log(chunk.toString()));
    });
    ```

30. **How do you handle CORS in Node.js?**  
    - Add CORS headers manually or use the `cors` package with Express.  
    ```javascript
    const cors = require('cors');
    app.use(cors());
    ```

    app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Home Route'));
    ```

34. **What is the difference between Express.js middleware and Koa.js middleware?**  
    - Express uses callback-based middleware.  
    - Koa uses modern async/await for cleaner code and better error handling.

35. **How do you handle errors in Express.js?**  
    - Define error-handling middleware:  
    ```javascript
    app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
      console.error(err.stack);
      res.status(500).send('Something broke!');
    });
    ```

### 11. **Advanced Topics**

46. **What is the difference between `process.nextTick()` and `setImmediate()`?**  
    - `process.nextTick()`: Executes callbacks before the next event loop phase.  
    - `setImmediate()`: Executes callbacks in the next event loop phase.

47. **Explain how worker threads are used in Node.js.**  
    - Used for CPU-intensive tasks.  
    ```javascript
    const { Worker } = require('worker_threads');
    const worker = new Worker('./worker.js');
    ```

48. **What is the purpose of the Node.js `cluster` module?**  
    - Enables creation of child processes to handle concurrent requests efficiently.

49. **How do you implement a WebSocket server in Node.js?**  
    - Use the `ws` library:  
    ```javascript
    const WebSocket = require('ws');
    const wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });
    wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
      ws.on('message', (message) => console.log(message));
      ws.send('Hello Client');
    });
    ```

50. **What is the significance of non-blocking I/O in Node.js?**  
    - Non-blocking I/O ensures high performance by freeing up the event loop for other operations while waiting for I/O tasks to complete.
